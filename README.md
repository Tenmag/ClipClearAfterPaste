### Clear the Windows Clipboard After Paste for your security

---

If you want to clear the Windows clipboard for security reasons, just run [ClipClearAfterPaste](https://github.com/Tenmag/ClipClearAfterPaste/releases). Every time you make a Ctrl+V, after the paste it clears the clipboard automatically, so you don't forget sensitive information on your clipboard for sneaky softwares and websites.

You can compile the source code with AutoHotkey.
